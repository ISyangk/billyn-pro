Local Business Backend 1.0 README
==========================

Thank you for downloading Local Business Backend distribution.

This distribution includes a full working NodeJS project
source code. It's ready to run (almost) out the box.

Overview
--------

Specifically, your pack consists of the following three
directories:

    * [project]
      Includes a Grunt based NodeJS project. This is the project
      that is suggested to be used for development.
    * [release]
      Includes a generated NodeJS project ready to be installed 
      on Heroku or any custom Nodejs equiped environment.
    * [license]
      Includes the License information and references to
      third-party licenses.

You can use the project to build a final web application or
to create your own NodeJS project, as long as this
is permitted by the License. You can dig into the source files and
modify them the way you want and reuse them, as long as this is permitted by
the License.
