Local Business Pro 2.0 README
==========================

Thank you for downloading Local Business Pro distribution.

This distribution includes the source code of two full working projects paired to work seamlessly together. Both of them are ready to run (almost) out the box.

Overview
--------

Specifically, your pack consists of the following two
directories:

    * [LocalBusinessMobile]
      Includes an Ionic/Cordova project. This is a mobile app which is 
      designed to work with the data provided by the Backend that comes with it.
    * [LocalBusinessBackend]
      Includes a NodeJS project. This app is recommended to be used in order to 
      feed the mobile app with all the data it needs. Local Business Backend can 
      be used to create/update the content of the Local Business Mobile app and 
      any other piece of software with similar data needs.
